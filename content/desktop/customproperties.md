This feature is available if you want to use one of the [3rd party tools that extend Mockups](/resources/extensions/), add additional details for developers, or anything else you can think of.

You can right-click on any control in your mockup and select "Custom Properties..." from the context menu:

![custompropertiesmenu](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/m4d/b3/custompropertiesmenu.png)

This will open a dialog like this one:

![custompropertiesdialog](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/m4d/b3/custompropertiesdialog.png)

In the dialog you can enter a custom ID for the selected control and some custom data to go with it. Balsamiq Mockups will not use these properties, but it will save them in the project along with the rest of your mockups.

Other tools can use this data to do some fancy stuff like allowing you to specify some javascript to run when the control is clicked or even just simply using the custom ID you specified in the exported code.
