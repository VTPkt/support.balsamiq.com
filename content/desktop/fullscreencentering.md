If your Full Screen Presentations are not centering on your mockups correctly, this FAQ is for you!

If you are running an up-to-date version of Balsamiq Mockups 3, you should see a link that says "Project Centering Rules" in the Full Screen Presentation settings panel.

Clicking on that link will open a window that gives you information about how your project it being centered.

In order to create a more seamless presentation, especially with linked mockups, Balsamiq Mockups 3 looks at the widest and tallest mockups in your project, and then centers the *whole* project based on them. This is great when all your mockups are around the same size, but doesn't work as well when there are mockups that are significantly larger than others.

In the Project Centering Rules window, you can see which mockups are affecting the overall centering of your project. If you uncheck those significantly larger mockups, the centering rules will adjust and exclude the large mockups from the average mockup size.

Excluding the larger mockups should allow your Full Screen Presentations to center properly (and be much more "presentable").

We put together a short video demonstrating how this feature works.
