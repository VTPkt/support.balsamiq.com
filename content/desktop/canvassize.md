The maximum size for each wireframe canvas is 4056x4056 pixels. Mockups automatically adjusts the canvas size to adapt to your content. This is the maximum canvas size that Adobe AIR apps allow. If the framework allows us to increase the canvas dimensions in the future we will.

If your wireframe bumps against the edges beyond 4056 pixels, you could try using a breakline to indicate continuation. This is something that designers often do in wireframe specs. Mockups supports breaklines in the Browser, Rectangle, Geometric Shape and Horizontal Rule controls.
