Balsamiq Mockups for Desktop, like many applications, creates a folder on your hard drive for storing some local data and preferences. It looks something like this:

You shouldn't ever need to open this folder, but we may ask you to locate it for troubleshooting purposes. The easiest way to find it is by opening the "About" dialog and clicking on the "Open Local Store Folder" link.

For reference, here is the location of this folder on the various operating systems that Balsamiq Mockups for Desktop runs on:

* **On Windows XP:** C:\Documents and Settings\\\<username>\Application Data\BalsamiqMockups3.EDE15CF69E11F7F7D45B5430C7D37CC6C3545E3C.1\Local Store
* **On Windows Vista and later:** C:\Users\\\<yourusername>\AppData\Roaming\BalsamiqMockups3.EDE15CF69E11F7F7D45B5430C7D37CC6C3545E3C.1\Local Store
* **On Mac OS X:** <your user home>/Library/Preferences/BalsamiqMockups3.EDE15CF69E11F7F7D45B5430C7D37CC6C3545E3C.1/Local Store

You can access it by opening a Finder window, clicking on the "Go" menu option at the top of your screen, and then pressing the "alt/option" key on your keyboard. That will make the Library folder selectable in the dropdown menu.{{% /alert %}}

## Unhiding System Files in Windows

In Windows 7, if you don't see Documents and Settings, you may need to "unhide system files." Here are the steps to do that:

1. Open Windows Explorer (Start+E)
2. Select the menu item "Organize > Folder and search options."
3. Select the View tab, and uncheck "Hide protected operating system files."

Documents and Settings should show up under C:\ in your Windows Explorer now. If it doesn't, you may need to restart.
