Yes!

Scott Faranello wrote a great introductory-level book called "Balsamiq Wireframes Quickstart Guide". You can [get it on Amazon here](http://www.amazon.com/Balsamiq-Wireframes-Quickstart-Guide-Faranello/dp/1849693528).

We think this book nicely complements [our support website](/), with easy-to-follow and quick-to-digest steps that will take you from zero to mastering our little tool in a very short time. We like this book so much we have started using it to train new Balsamiq employees! :)

​From the amazon.com description:

> _This book is a step-by-step guide to learning Balsamiq and wireframing in general. Written in an engaging, easy to follow style and flow, readers can utilize free, downloadable templates that teach by building upon previous chapters until each lesson is learned and applied, ensuring true learning, not just memorization._

There is also an awesome [eBook of Balsamiq Interviews](https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/interviews/) by Bob Walsh that includes interviews with nine different Balsamiq users (including our own [Michael Angeles](https://balsamiq.com/company/#mike)). Each interviewee contributes an interesting perspective on using Balsamiq and its advantages and limitations.

It's a great complement to our [Case Studies on our blog](https://blog.balsamiq.com/category/case-studies/). Also, **it's free!** [Get it here](https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/interviews/).
