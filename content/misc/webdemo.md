With the launch of our new web version, [Balsamiq Cloud](https://balsamiq.cloud/), we have decided to close down our old web demo. It was based on Adobe Flash, and it was time for us to move on to a **native** editor. :)

## What Can I Use to Try out Your Product Instead?

Balsamiq Cloud comes with a 30 day free trial (just like [all our products](https://support.balsamiq.com/sales/evaluate/)). It is fully functional so you'll get the chance to explore the whole package. See our Cloud documentation [here](https://docs.balsamiq.com/cloud/) for more details.

## How Do I Import My Existing File(s) in Balsamiq Cloud?

{{% alert info %}}**Note:** These steps assume that you already have an existing Balsamiq Cloud account and [Space](https://docs.balsamiq.com/cloud/spaces/). If you don’t already have one, make sure to check out the [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.balsamiq.com/cloud/intro/#quick-start-guide) to get started on your project.{{% /alert %}}

Before we turn it off (in a few days), here’s the [direct url](https://webdemo.balsamiq.com/) so you can go download your work. Both the old web demo and Balsamiq Cloud use our BMPR file format, so moving your file there is pretty easy.

Once you have your project opened in the web demo, you can download it locally by using the **Download BMPR** option in the Project menu, as shown below.

Then you can easily [upload it as a new project](https://docs.balsamiq.com/cloud/projects/) in Balsamiq Cloud.
