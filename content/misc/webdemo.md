With the launch of our new web version, [Balsamiq Cloud](https://balsamiq.cloud/), we have decided to close down our old web demo. It was based on Adobe Flash, and it was time for us to move on to a **native** editor. :)

## What Can I Use to Try Out Your Product Instead?

Balsamiq Cloud comes with a 30 day free trial (just like [all our products](https://support.balsamiq.com/sales/evaluate/)). It is fully functional so you'll get the chance to explore the whole package. See our Cloud documentation [here](https://docs.balsamiq.com/cloud/) for more details.

## How Do I Import My Existing File(s) in Balsamiq Cloud?

{{% alert info %}}**Note:** These steps assume that you already have an existing Balsamiq Cloud account and [Space](https://docs.balsamiq.com/cloud/spaces/). If you donâ€™t already have one, make sure to check out the [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.balsamiq.com/cloud/intro/#quick-start-guide) to get started on your project.{{% /alert %}}

Both the old web demo and Balsamiq Cloud use the BMPR file format, so moving your file there is pretty easy.

Once you have your project (BMPR file) saved locally, you can easily [upload it as a new project](https://docs.balsamiq.com/cloud/projects/) in Balsamiq Cloud.

As an alternative option, you can [import it from inside the Balsamiq Cloud editor](https://docs.balsamiq.com/cloud/importing/#importing-from-other-versions-of-balsamiq) if needed.
