## Is There an iPad Version in the Works?

We are in the process of moving our entire codebase to native platforms, which will make a mobile version of our app a lot easier. While it's not in active development right now, we hope to be able to start on it soon!

Stay tuned to our release announcements on our [release announcements page](https://blog.balsamiq.com/category/release-notes/).

## Do You Have Any Resources to Help Me Design or Test My Mobile Application?

Check out our [tutorial on Creating a Mobile Application](/tutorials/mobileapplication/) to learn some tips and tricks for using the iOS controls included with Mockups.

For testing, follow [this tutorial on user-testing your iPad wireframes](/tutorials/ipad/). There are also several [products that allow you to test your prototypes](/resources/extensions/#user-testing-your-mockups) created with myBalsamiq or from a clickable PDF.

## Can I Use the Online Version (myBalsamiq) on My iPad?

The Balsamiq Mockups editor relies on Adobe Flash, so you can't edit your wireframes on your iPad. You can, however, browse your projects and view the wireframes in [myBalsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/mybalsamiq/). [Prototype view](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/sharing/#send-them-a-prototype-view-link) also works, if you want to user-test your mockups on an iPad.
