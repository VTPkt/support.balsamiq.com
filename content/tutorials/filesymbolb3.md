If you have a Mockups file that you want to use as a Symbol, here's how you can add it to Balsamiq Mockups for Desktop as a Project Asset.

{{% alert info %}}**Note:** For [Balsamiq Mockups 3](https://docs.balsamiq.com/desktop/intro/), follow [**these instructions**](https://docs.balsamiq.com/desktop/symbols/#importing-symbols) instead.{{% /alert %}}

## 1\. Locate the Mockups File on Your Computer

![Locate the Mockups file on your computer](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/guides/How_to_use_an_existing_file_as_a_Symbol_in_Mockups_for_Desktop/media_1380045665749.png)

If you downloaded it from Mockups To Go, it may be in your Downloads folder.

## 2\. Open the Folder Containing the Mockups You'd like to Use the Symbol With

In this example, I want the Symbols to be available to the mockups in my "Website Redesign" project.

## 3\. Create a Folder Named "Assets" inside That Folder

Note: this folder may already exist. If so, skip this step.

## 4\. Move the Mockups File to The "Assets" Folder

You don't need to open the file. The next steps show how to access it.

## 5\. Open Any Mockups File in the Project Folder

Open any Mockups file in the project folder")

Balsamiq Mockups checks for a the presence of a sub-folder called "assets" in any mockup that's open, so it will recognize that there is now an assets folder with a Mockups file in it.

## 6\. Look in the Project Assets Category for the Symbol(S) You've Added

[![Look in the Project Assets category for the Symbol you've added](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/guides/How_to_use_an_existing_file_as_a_Symbol_in_Mockups_for_Desktop/media_1380047062550.png)](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/guides/How_to_use_an_existing_file_as_a_Symbol_in_Mockups_for_Desktop/media_1380047062550_lg.png "6\.

**That's it!** You can now add them to the canvas just like other controls. They will also be available in the All category as well as from the Quick Add search box.
