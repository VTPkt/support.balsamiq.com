{{% alert warning %}}**Heads Up!** This tutorial is for Balsamiq Mockups version 2. To learn how to [create symbols in Balsamiq Mockups 3, read this article](https://docs.balsamiq.com/desktop/symbols/).{{% /alert %}}

This lesson will show you the steps to create a _Symbol_ (also called template, master or widget) from within Balsamiq Mockups. Symbols let you create reusable elements that are available to different mockups. They prevent you from having to create the same set of controls multiple times and allow you to make a change in one place and have it update across files.

This process is the same for both Mockups for Desktop and myBalsamiq. Symbols are not yet supported in all versions of Mockups. See [this page](https://balsamiq.com/products/) for details.

## 1\. Add the UI Controls You Want to Use as a Symbol

[![Add the UI Controls you want to use as a Symbol](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/guides/How_to_Create_a_Symbol/media_1379616291851.png)](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/guides/How_to_Create_a_Symbol/media_1379616291851_lg.png "1\. Add the UI Controls you want to use as a Symbol")

I've added a few controls for a simple login form.

## 2\. Select the Controls You've Added

[![Select the Controls you've added](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/guides/How_to_Create_a_Symbol/media_1379616597803.png)](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/guides/How_to_Create_a_Symbol/media_1379616597803_lg.png "2\. Select the Controls you've added")

Use the mouse to drag a selection area around them or use Shift+click.

* * *

## 3\. Group the Controls

[![Group the Controls](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/guides/How_to_Create_a_Symbol/media_1379618839406.png)](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/guides/How_to_Create_a_Symbol/media_1379618839406_lg.png "3\. Group the Controls")

The keyboard shortcut for grouping Controls is CTRL/CMD+G.

The color changes to purple once the Controls have been grouped. **Note:** you should save your mockup at this point if you haven't already. The Symbol you are creating will be available to other mockups in the same folder, so pay attention to where you save it.

* * *

## 4\. Give the Group a Name

[![Give the group a name](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/guides/How_to_Create_a_Symbol/media_1379616384025.png)](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/guides/How_to_Create_a_Symbol/media_1379616384025_lg.png "4\. Give the group a name")

This will become the Symbol name, so it should be something that will be easy to identify.

* * *

## 5\. Click the Convert to Symbol Button

[![Click the Convert To Symbol button](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/guides/How_to_Create_a_Symbol/media_1379618677613.png)](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/guides/How_to_Create_a_Symbol/media_1379618677613_lg.png "5\. Click the Convert To Symbol button")

Notice how the group now changes to green and the Property Inspector shows it as a Symbol.

## 6\. Use the Symbol by Adding It from the UI Library

[![Use the Symbol by adding it from the UI Library](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/guides/How_to_Create_a_Symbol/media_1379616484725.png)](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/guides/How_to_Create_a_Symbol/media_1379616484725_lg.png "6\. Use the Symbol by adding it from the UI Library")

Click on the Project Assets tab in the UI Library and you will see the Symbol you just created. It will also appear in the All category and in the Quick Add menu, just like the other UI Controls. You can use the Symbol in any mockup that's in the _same folder_ as the current mockup.
