When an employee leaves, it can be frustrating trying to tie up all the loose ends. Moreso if that employee was the Owner of the Space you've been working on.

We recommend that the Owner [transfers the Space ownership](https://docs.balsamiq.com/cloud/spaces/#changing-and-adding-space-owners) to someone else before leaving. However, we understand that this isn't always possible.

This quick guide is designed to give you tips on how to possibly reclaim a Balsamiq Cloud Space by transferring its ownership to someone who's still at the company.

## Step by Step Instructions

Here's what to do:

1.  Take over the employee's company email - this is pretty much standard procedure in order to reclaim all the different online accounts. Get your IT team involved if the account has been disabled and needs to be reactivated.
2.  Head to your Balsamiq Cloud's Space login page and click on "Forgot Password?" to initiate the password reset process.
3.  Enter the employee's email address and click on "Send Me a Reset Password Link"
4.  From the employee's email, click on the reset password link in the email and set a new password.
5.  Once logged in, head over to Settings > Space Owners and select a different staff member to become the new Space Owner from the dropdown menu.
6.  Click on "Transfer Space Ownership" and log out.
7.  Have the new Space Owner log in and remove the departed Staff Member from the Space (from the [Staff page](https://docs.balsamiq.com/cloud/spaces/#managing-users))
8.  If necessary, have the new Space Owner change the credit card information following [these simple instructions](/sales/cloudsubscriptions/#updating-your-credit-card-or-invoice-information).

## What If I Don't Have Access to Their Email? Can Balsamiq Make the Change for Me?

Per our [Terms of Use](https://docs.balsamiq.com/cloud/tos/#who-can-see-my-password), we cannot change ownership of Balsamiq Cloud Spaces ourselves. If the person that set up your Space was an external contractor, or if they used a non-company email address, you will need to ask them to please assign the Space Ownership to one of your company's staff members.

You can also ask them to [download](https://docs.balsamiq.com/cloud/projects/#cloning-downloading-and-deleting-projects) and send you the project files directly, and you can then upload them into a new Cloud Space that is owned by a current staff member.

If none of these options work, [let us know](mailto:sales@balsamiq.com?subject=Our%20space%20owner%20left%20and%20we%20need%20help%20canceling%20our%20Cloud%20subscription). Even though we cannot help you regain access to the data, we can help you by stopping your automatic monthly payment, and/or refunding recent charges.
