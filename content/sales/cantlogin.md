Arg! Sorry about that. This page is here to help.

Ok, so, first we need to figure out which one of our products you are using.

Are you using the Desktop version ([Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Desktop](https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/))? If so, _there is no password or login required for using Mockups 3 for Desktop_.  Just [download](https://balsamiq.com/download/), install and launch.

You also **don't** need a Balsamiq login or password for:

*   [Balsamiq Wireframes for Confluence](https://docs.balsamiq.com/confluence/) - log in using your Confluence account 
*   [Balsamiq Wireframes for Jira](https://docs.balsamiq.com/jira/) - log in using your Jira account
*   [Balsamiq for Google Drive](https://docs.balsamiq.com/google-drive/wireframes/intro/) - log in using your Google or Gmail account

The only product we offer that you do need a login and password for is **[myBalsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/mybalsamiq/)** - the online version of Balsamiq Mockups that we also host. If you can't remember your login or password for your myBalsamiq site, you can [reset your password here](https://www.mybalsamiq.com/forgotpassword).

If you're still having trouble, please email [support@balsamiq.com](mailto:support@balsamiq.com), preferably with the name or address of your myBalsamiq site (e.g., https://_something_.mybalsamiq.com/).

## Lost License Key

If you've lost your License Key to register one of our products, [start here to retrieve your License Key](https://balsamiq.com/buy/lostkey/). Make sure to use the email that you used when you purchased the product.

## Getting an Invoice

If you just want an invoice for one of our products that you paid for, check out [this page on getting an invoice](/sales/invoice/).
