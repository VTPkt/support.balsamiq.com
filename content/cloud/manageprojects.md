Your Balsamiq Cloud subscription plan allows for a certain maximum number of projects, so managing them is very important. Here is one of the ways you can do that

## Download Your Project

The first step in archiving your projects in Balsamiq Cloud is to download them. You can do that from your project home page.

Select the "Download Project BMPR" option from the project's panel to save the project to your hard drive.

## Delete Your Project

Now that you have a local copy of your project, it is safe to delete it from your Balsamiq Cloud site. To do that, select the "Delete Project" from the project's panel.

A confirmation dialog will pop up to ensure that you want to delete the project. Take a moment to locate the project file on your hard drive, just to be sure you have it, and then click "Delete Project".

That's it, you have made room for another project on your Balsamiq Cloud site.

## Backing Up Your Local Files

We cannot tell you what the best way for you to backup your project (.bmpr) files is, now that you have them downloaded. We recommend signing up for a cloud storage service (like [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) or [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com)) and storing the project files there. You should use whatever backup method you are most comfortable with. :)
